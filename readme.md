# CMO Notes

Lecture notes for the course 'Computational Methods of Optimization' (Aug-Dec 2019) at IISc,
taught by [Prof. Chiranjib Bhattacharyya](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~chiru/). Scribed by Eklavya Sharma (<https://github.com/sharmaeklavya2>)

Course website: <https://cmo2019.github.io/cmo2019/>

All notes are written in LaTeX and markdown.

To compile all latex files to PDF and all markdown files to HTMl at once, run `python3 build.py`
(requires python 3.5+ and `pdflatex` to be installed).
This will put all PDF files in a directory named `output`.
