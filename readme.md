# Notes

This repository contains notes I wrote while studying computer science.

Currently all notes are written in LaTeX and markdown.

To compile all latex files to PDF and all markdown files to HTMl at once, run `python3 build.py`
(requires python 3.5+ and `pdflatex` to be installed).
This will put all PDF files in a directory named `output`.
