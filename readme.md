# Notes

This repository contains notes I wrote while studying computer science.

Currently all notes are written in LaTeX.

You can compile all latex files to PDF at once by running `python3 build.py`
(requires python 3.5+ and `pdflatex` to be installed).
This will put all PDF files in a directory named `output`.
