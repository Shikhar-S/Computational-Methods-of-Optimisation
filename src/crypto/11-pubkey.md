* Need for securely distributing public keys.
* Definition of a public-key encryption scheme as the triple (Gen, Enc, Dec).
* ind-cpa experiment and ind-cpa security.
* Impossibility of perfectly secret public-key encryption schemes.
* Insecurity of deterministic encryption schemes.
* ind-mult-cpa experiment and ind-mult-cpa security.
* encrypting arbitrary length messages using ind-mult-cpa secure scheme.
* Proof that ind-cpa security implies ind-mult-cpa security.
* ind-cca experiment and security.
* hybrid encryption and kem-dem paradigm.
* proof of security of hybrid encryption scheme.
